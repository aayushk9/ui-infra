FRONTEND MASTERY

this repository exists to understand frontend fundamentals and have fun with frontenda/design engineering

made this repo to explore  
1) why a specific language/lib/framework was even needed  
2) how it actually works under the hood  
3) break react and next (the pillars of modern frontend)  
4) build weird/crazy architectures purely for learning  
5) mess around with ai tools and ship cool stuff someone might need someday lol  
6) talk code like a psychopath (brainstorm.txt)

ai tools dir/ mostly vibe coding + notes on models/agents  
architecture dir/ system sketches and diagrams  
breaknext dir/ exploring next.js internals  
breakreact dir/ exploring react internals  
js dir/ javascript experiments  
ts dir/ typescript experiments  
raw solutions dir/ excalidraw problem solving without ai  
brainstorm dir/ if you wanna know me, start here


thinking of adding folder for (web secuirty, web architecture)
